# Focus 2 Workbook Scraper

A Python web scraper designed to extract all lessons and answers from the Focus 2 Workbook from Studifor.com.

The tool is especially useful for students who want to have a local, searchable copy of the workbook content for study purposes.

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required packages:
  - requests
  - beautifulsoup4
  - tqdm

## üì• Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/focus2-workbook-scraper.git
   cd focus2-workbook-scraper
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 tqdm
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

Run the scraper with:

```bash
python scraper.py
```

The script will:

1. Create a `data` directory (if it doesn't exist)
2. Fetch all sections and exercises from the website
3. Extract content from each exercise page
4. Save the data in three formats:
   - `data/focus_2_workbook.json`: Structured JSON data
   - `data/focus_2_workbook.md`: Markdown documentation
   - `data/focus_2_workbook.txt`: Clean text format for Word

### Test Mode

For testing purposes, you can enable test mode by setting `test_mode = True` in the `main()` function. This will limit the scraper to only process 5 exercises, allowing you to verify functionality before running a full scrape.
